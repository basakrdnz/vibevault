## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse Popular Content (Priority: P1)

A logged-in user browses curated lists of popular movies, series, and documentaries to discover content they might want to watch and log.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary way users discover content to log. Without browsing functionality, users cannot find content to add to their viewing history.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and successfully viewing curated content lists with proper categorization and information display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they visit the browse page, **Then** they see curated lists of popular movies, series, and documentaries
2. **Given** a user is browsing content, **When** they scroll through the lists, **Then** they can load more results seamlessly
3. **Given** a user views content lists, **When** they see the information, **Then** each item displays title, poster, release year, and basic details
4. **Given** a user wants to see more details, **When** they click on a title, **Then** they see comprehensive information about that content

---

### User Story 2 - Search for Specific Content (Priority: P1)

A user searches for specific movies, series, or documentaries by title, actor, or other criteria to find content they want to log.

**Why this priority**: Search is essential for users who know what they want to find. This enables users to quickly locate specific content they've watched or want to watch.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by using the search function to find specific content and verifying that results are relevant and accurate.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to find specific content, **When** they use the search function, **Then** they see relevant results from TMDB API
2. **Given** a user searches for a title, **When** they enter the search term, **Then** they see results within 3 seconds
3. **Given** a user searches for content, **When** no results are found, **Then** they see an appropriate "no results" message
4. **Given** a user searches for partial titles, **When** they enter partial text, **Then** they see relevant matches

---

### User Story 3 - View Content Details (Priority: P2)

A user views detailed information about movies, series, or documentaries to decide whether to log them or learn more about content they've watched.

**Why this priority**: While browsing and search are essential, detailed content information helps users make informed decisions about what to log and provides context for their viewing experiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking on any content item and verifying that comprehensive details are displayed accurately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user clicks on a title, **When** they view the details page, **Then** they see comprehensive information including synopsis, cast, ratings, and release date
2. **Given** a user views content details, **When** they see the information, **Then** it's clearly organized and easy to read
3. **Given** a user wants to log content, **When** they view details, **Then** they see a clear "Log This" button or option
4. **Given** a user views series details, **When** they see the information, **Then** they can distinguish between movies and series appropriately
