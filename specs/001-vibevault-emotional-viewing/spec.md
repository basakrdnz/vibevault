## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Landing Page and Authentication (Priority: P1)

A new visitor discovers VibeVault through the landing page, understands its purpose, and creates an account to start logging their viewing experiences.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for all users and establishes the foundation for the entire application. Without authentication, no other features can be used.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the landing page, reading the purpose description, and successfully creating an account and logging in.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they read the content, **Then** they understand VibeVault is for logging movies/series/documentaries with emotional experiences
2. **Given** a visitor wants to use the app, **When** they click register, **Then** they can create an account with email and password
3. **Given** a user has an account, **When** they enter credentials and click login, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the main dashboard
4. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they click logout, **Then** they are signed out and returned to the landing page

---

### User Story 2 - Browse and Search Content (Priority: P1)

A logged-in user browses movies, series, and documentaries from TMDB API, searches for specific content, and views detailed information about titles.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables users to discover and select content to log. Without this, users cannot add entries to their viewing history.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging in and successfully browsing, searching, and viewing content details from the TMDB API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they visit the browse page, **Then** they see a curated list of popular movies, series, and documentaries
2. **Given** a user wants to find specific content, **When** they use the search function, **Then** they see relevant results from TMDB API
3. **Given** a user clicks on a title, **When** they view the details, **Then** they see comprehensive information including synopsis, cast, ratings, and release date
4. **Given** a user is browsing content, **When** they scroll or navigate, **Then** they can load more results seamlessly

---

### User Story 3 - Log Viewing Experience (Priority: P1)

A user logs a movie, series, or documentary they've watched, including their emotional response, rating, and personal notes about their experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary value proposition of VibeVault - capturing not just what users watched, but how it made them feel. This is the core differentiator from simple rating apps.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a title and successfully logging a complete viewing experience with emotional notes and rating.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user finds content they want to log, **When** they click "Log This", **Then** they see a form to record their viewing experience
2. **Given** a user is logging content, **When** they select emotional responses and add notes, **Then** the system saves their complete experience
3. **Given** a user rates content, **When** they submit their log entry, **Then** it appears in their viewing history with all details preserved
4. **Given** a user wants to mark content as favorite, **When** they toggle the favorite option, **Then** it's added to their favorites list

---

### User Story 4 - View Personal History and Favorites (Priority: P2)

A user reviews their viewing history, sees patterns in their emotional responses over time, and manages their favorite content collection.

**Why this priority**: This provides users with insights into their viewing patterns and emotional responses, which is a key value proposition for understanding their media consumption habits.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging multiple entries and then viewing the history and favorites sections to see all logged content with emotional data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has logged multiple viewing experiences, **When** they visit their history, **Then** they see a chronological list of all logged content
2. **Given** a user views their history, **When** they click on a previous entry, **Then** they see their original emotional notes and rating
3. **Given** a user has marked favorites, **When** they visit the favorites section, **Then** they see all their favorite content organized for easy access
4. **Given** a user wants to see patterns, **When** they review their history, **Then** they can identify trends in their emotional responses over time

---

### User Story 5 - Account Management (Priority: P3)

A user manages their account settings, updates their profile information, and controls their privacy preferences.

**Why this priority**: While important for user control and privacy, this is secondary to the core viewing experience functionality. Users can use the app effectively without immediately needing to customize settings.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing settings and successfully updating account information and preferences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to update their profile, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can modify their account information
2. **Given** a user wants to change privacy settings, **When** they adjust preferences, **Then** their changes are saved and applied
3. **Given** a user wants to delete their account, **When** they request account deletion, **Then** they receive confirmation and their data is removed

- What happens when a user's session expires while they're logging content?
- How does the system handle very long emotional notes or special characters?
- What happens when users search for content that doesn't exist in TMDB?
