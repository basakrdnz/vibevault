# Feature Specification: VibeVault Social Features

**Feature Branch**: `007-vibevault-social-features`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Social features for connecting with friends, sharing viewing experiences, and building a community around emotional movie logging

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Send Friend Requests (Priority: P1)

A user sends friend requests to other VibeVault users by email to connect and share their viewing experiences.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the social feature. Without the ability to send friend requests, users cannot connect with others to share their experiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a friend request to another user's email and verifying the request is sent successfully.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to add a friend, **When** they enter a friend's email address, **Then** they can send a friend request
2. **Given** a user sends a friend request, **When** the request is sent, **Then** the recipient receives a notification
3. **Given** a user tries to add someone who isn't on VibeVault, **When** they send a request, **Then** they receive an appropriate message
4. **Given** a user tries to add someone they're already friends with, **When** they attempt to send a request, **Then** they receive a clear error message

### User Story 2 - Manage Friend Requests (Priority: P1)

A user receives, reviews, and accepts or declines friend requests from other VibeVault users.

**Why this priority**: Users need to control who can see their viewing history and emotional experiences. This is essential for privacy and user control.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by receiving a friend request and successfully accepting or declining it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user receives a friend request, **When** they view their requests, **Then** they see the sender's information and can accept or decline
2. **Given** a user accepts a friend request, **When** they confirm, **Then** the friendship is established and both users can see each other's content
3. **Given** a user declines a friend request, **When** they confirm, **Then** the request is removed and no connection is made
4. **Given** a user has pending requests, **When** they view their requests, **Then** they can see all pending requests clearly

### User Story 3 - View Friends' Viewing History (Priority: P1)

A user views their friends' viewing history and emotional experiences to discover new content and share in their friends' viewing journeys.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value of the social feature - sharing emotional viewing experiences with friends. This creates community and helps users discover content through their friends' experiences.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing a friend's history and seeing their logged content with emotional responses and notes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has friends, **When** they view a friend's profile, **Then** they can see their friend's viewing history
2. **Given** a user views a friend's history, **When** they see the entries, **Then** they can see the content, emotional responses, ratings, and personal notes
3. **Given** a user wants to see recent activity, **When** they view a friend's profile, **Then** they can see their friend's most recent viewing experiences
4. **Given** a user views a friend's content, **When** they see something interesting, **Then** they can easily access the content details to learn more

### User Story 4 - Manage Friends List (Priority: P2)

A user manages their friends list by viewing all connections, removing friends, and organizing their social connections.

**Why this priority**: Users need control over their social connections. This allows them to maintain their privacy and manage their social experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the friends list and successfully removing a friend from the list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to see their friends, **When** they view their friends list, **Then** they see all their current friends with basic information
2. **Given** a user wants to remove a friend, **When** they select remove friend, **Then** the friendship is ended and they can no longer see each other's content
3. **Given** a user removes a friend, **When** they confirm the action, **Then** both users lose access to each other's viewing history
4. **Given** a user has many friends, **When** they view their friends list, **Then** they can easily find and manage their connections

---

### User Story 5 - Privacy and Social Settings (Priority: P2)

A user controls their privacy settings to determine what information friends can see and manage their social preferences.

**Why this priority**: Privacy is crucial for social features. Users need control over what they share and with whom they share it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adjusting privacy settings and verifying that friends see the appropriate level of information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to control privacy, **When** they access social settings, **Then** they can adjust what friends can see
2. **Given** a user changes privacy settings, **When** they save changes, **Then** their friends' access is updated accordingly
3. **Given** a user wants to hide certain content, **When** they adjust settings, **Then** friends cannot see the hidden content
4. **Given** a user wants to be private, **When** they set their profile to private, **Then** only approved friends can see their content
