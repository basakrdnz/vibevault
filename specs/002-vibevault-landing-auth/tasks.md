# Implementation Tasks: VibeVault Landing Page & Authentication

**Feature**: 002-vibevault-landing-auth  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Tech Stack**: NextJS 14, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js, Tailwind CSS

## Summary

This document breaks down the implementation of VibeVault's landing page and authentication system into actionable, dependency-ordered tasks. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1) to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Total Tasks**: 47  
**User Stories**: 3 (all P1 priority)  
**Parallel Opportunities**: 12 tasks can be executed in parallel

## Dependencies

### User Story Completion Order
- **US1 (Landing Page)**: Can be implemented independently
- **US2 (Registration)**: Requires US1 for navigation, depends on foundational tasks
- **US3 (Login)**: Requires US2 for user accounts, depends on foundational tasks

### Foundational Dependencies
- Database setup must complete before any user story
- Authentication configuration must complete before US2 and US3
- UI components must be available before all user stories

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Landing Page) for initial deployment  
**Incremental Delivery**: Each user story is independently testable  
**Parallel Execution**: UI components, API routes, and database setup can run in parallel

## Independent Test Criteria

### User Story 1 (Landing Page)
- **Test**: Visit landing page and verify understanding of app purpose
- **Criteria**: User can identify VibeVault as emotional movie logging app
- **Validation**: User can explain key features without additional help

### User Story 2 (Registration)  
- **Test**: Complete registration with valid information
- **Criteria**: Account created successfully, user redirected to login
- **Validation**: User can log in with newly created credentials

### User Story 3 (Login)
- **Test**: Log in with valid credentials and access dashboard
- **Criteria**: User authenticated, session established, redirected appropriately
- **Validation**: User can access protected areas and logout successfully

## MVP Scope Recommendation

**Initial Release**: User Story 1 (Landing Page) only  
**Rationale**: Establishes foundation and user understanding  
**Next Iteration**: Add User Stories 2 & 3 (Registration & Login)  
**Future**: Password reset, email verification, OAuth providers
