## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Landing Page Discovery (Priority: P1)

A new visitor discovers VibeVault through the landing page and understands its purpose and value proposition for logging emotional viewing experiences.

**Why this priority**: This is the entry point for all users. Without a clear, compelling landing page, users won't understand what VibeVault offers or why they should use it.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by visiting the landing page and verifying that a new visitor understands the app's purpose and value proposition without any additional explanation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new visitor lands on the homepage, **When** they read the content, **Then** they understand VibeVault is for logging movies/series with emotional experiences
2. **Given** a visitor wants to learn more, **When** they scroll through the landing page, **Then** they see clear explanations of key features and benefits
3. **Given** a visitor is interested, **When** they see the call-to-action, **Then** they understand how to get started with the app

### User Story 2 - User Registration (Priority: P1)

A new visitor creates an account to start using VibeVault for logging their viewing experiences.

**Why this priority**: Registration is required for all other functionality. Users must be able to create accounts to access the core features of the app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully creating a new account with valid information and receiving confirmation of account creation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor wants to register, **When** they click the register button, **Then** they see a registration form
2. **Given** a user fills out the registration form, **When** they submit valid information, **Then** their account is created successfully
3. **Given** a user submits invalid information, **When** they attempt to register, **Then** they receive clear error messages
4. **Given** a user tries to register with an existing email, **When** they submit the form, **Then** they receive an appropriate error message

### User Story 3 - User Login (Priority: P1)

A registered user logs into their VibeVault account to access their personal viewing logs and features.

**Why this priority**: Login is essential for accessing personalized features. Users must be able to securely authenticate to use the app.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by successfully logging in with valid credentials and being redirected to the main application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user wants to log in, **When** they enter valid credentials, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the dashboard
2. **Given** a user enters invalid credentials, **When** they attempt to log in, **Then** they receive an appropriate error message
3. **Given** a user forgets their password, **When** they click "forgot password", **Then** they can reset their password
4. **Given** a user is logged in, **When** they click logout, **Then** they are signed out and returned to the landing page
