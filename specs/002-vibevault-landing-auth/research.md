# Research: VibeVault Landing Page & Authentication

**Feature**: 002-vibevault-landing-auth  
**Date**: 2025-01-27  
**Purpose**: Technology decisions and best practices for NextJS authentication system

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework: NextJS 14

**Decision**: NextJS 14 with App Router  
**Rationale**: 
- Server-side rendering for SEO optimization
- Built-in API routes for authentication endpoints
- App Router provides better performance and developer experience
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Built-in optimization for images, fonts, and scripts

**Alternatives considered**:
- **React + Vite**: Lacks SSR capabilities needed for SEO
- **SvelteKit**: Smaller ecosystem, less authentication libraries
- **Nuxt.js**: Vue.js based, team prefers React

### Authentication: NextAuth.js

**Decision**: NextAuth.js v4 with credentials provider  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for NextJS authentication
- Built-in session management and security features
- Supports multiple providers (credentials, OAuth)
- GDPR compliant by default
- Excellent TypeScript support

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Clerk**: Too expensive for MVP, overkill for simple auth
- **Supabase Auth**: Good but ties us to Supabase ecosystem
- **Custom JWT**: Security risks, too much implementation overhead

### Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma

**Decision**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM  
**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance for user data integrity
- Excellent performance and scalability
- Prisma provides type-safe database access
- Great migration system
- Strong ecosystem and community support

**Alternatives considered**:
- **MongoDB**: No ACID guarantees, complex for relational data
- **SQLite**: Not suitable for production with multiple users
- **MySQL**: Less advanced features compared to PostgreSQL

### Database Hosting: Supabase

**Decision**: Supabase for PostgreSQL hosting  
**Rationale**:
- Managed PostgreSQL with automatic backups
- Built-in real-time capabilities for future features
- Generous free tier for development
- Easy scaling and monitoring
- Excellent NextJS integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Railway**: Good but less features than Supabase
- **PlanetScale**: MySQL-based, not PostgreSQL
- **Self-hosted**: Too much DevOps overhead for MVP

### Styling: Tailwind CSS

**Decision**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components  
**Rationale**:
- Utility-first approach for rapid development
- Excellent responsive design capabilities
- shadcn/ui provides pre-built accessible components
- Great TypeScript integration
- Consistent design system

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Styled Components**: Runtime overhead, less performant
- **CSS Modules**: More verbose, less rapid development
- **Material-UI**: Too opinionated, less customization

### Testing: Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright

**Decision**: Jest for unit tests, RTL for component tests, Playwright for E2E  
**Rationale**:
- Jest is industry standard for React testing
- React Testing Library focuses on user behavior
- Playwright provides excellent E2E testing capabilities
- Great TypeScript support across all tools
- Excellent debugging and reporting

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Vitest**: Good but less ecosystem maturity
- **Cypress**: Good but Playwright has better performance
- **Testing Library**: Already included in RTL

## Best Practices Research

### Authentication Security

**Password Hashing**: bcrypt with salt rounds 12  
**Session Management**: HTTP-only cookies with secure flags  
**CSRF Protection**: Built into NextAuth.js  
**Rate Limiting**: Implemented at API route level  

### Performance Optimization

**Image Optimization**: NextJS Image component with WebP format  
**Font Loading**: NextJS font optimization with display: swap  
**Code Splitting**: Automatic with NextJS App Router  
**Caching**: Static generation for landing page, ISR for dynamic content  

### Responsive Design

**Mobile-First**: Design for mobile, enhance for desktop  
**Breakpoints**: sm (640px), md (768px), lg (1024px), xl (1280px)  
**Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile interactions  
**Viewport**: Proper meta viewport tag for mobile rendering  

### Accessibility

**WCAG 2.1 AA**: Compliance for all components  
**Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility  
**Screen Readers**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML  
**Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text  

## Integration Patterns

### NextAuth.js + Prisma Integration

**Pattern**: Custom adapter for Prisma  
**Implementation**: Use @auth/prisma-adapter  
**Benefits**: Type-safe database operations, automatic schema generation  

### API Route Structure

**Pattern**: RESTful API with NextJS API routes  
**Structure**: /api/auth/[...nextauth] for authentication  
**Validation**: Zod for request validation  
**Error Handling**: Consistent error responses with proper HTTP status codes  

### Database Schema Design

**Pattern**: Normalized schema with proper relationships  
**User Table**: id, email, password, createdAt, updatedAt  
**Session Table**: Managed by NextAuth.js  
**Account Table**: Managed by NextAuth.js for OAuth providers  

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

**Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest  
**Transmission**: HTTPS only with HSTS headers  
**Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs  
**SQL Injection**: Prevented by Prisma ORM  

### Privacy Compliance

**GDPR**: User consent for data processing  
**Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies  
**Right to Deletion**: User can delete their account and data  
**Data Export**: Users can export their data  

## Performance Targets

**Page Load**: <3 seconds on 3G networks  
**Lighthouse Score**: 95+ for all pages  
**API Response**: <200ms for authentication operations  
**Database Queries**: <100ms for user operations  
**Bundle Size**: <250KB for initial JavaScript bundle  

## Deployment Strategy

**Platform**: Vercel for NextJS hosting  
**Database**: Supabase for PostgreSQL  
**CDN**: Vercel Edge Network for global distribution  
**Monitoring**: Vercel Analytics + Sentry for error tracking  
**CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment  

## Development Workflow

**Version Control**: Git with conventional commits  
**Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier for code formatting  
**Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration  
**Testing**: Unit tests required for all utilities, E2E for critical flows  
**Code Review**: Required for all changes  

## Future Considerations

**Scalability**: Database connection pooling, Redis for sessions  
**Features**: OAuth providers (Google, GitHub), password reset  
**Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring, user analytics  
**Internationalization**: i18n support for multiple languages
