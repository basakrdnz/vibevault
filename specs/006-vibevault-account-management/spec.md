## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Manage Account Settings (Priority: P2)

A user updates their account information, preferences, and settings to customize their VibeVault experience.

**Why this priority**: While not essential for core functionality, account management provides users with control over their experience and data. This is important for user satisfaction and privacy.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing settings and successfully updating account information and preferences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to update their profile, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can modify their account information
2. **Given** a user changes their email, **When** they save the changes, **Then** the system validates the new email format
3. **Given** a user updates their preferences, **When** they save changes, **Then** their preferences are applied immediately
4. **Given** a user wants to change their password, **When** they enter a new password, **Then** the system validates password strength

### User Story 2 - Privacy and Data Control (Priority: P2)

A user controls their privacy settings and manages their personal data within VibeVault.

**Why this priority**: Privacy and data control are important for user trust and compliance. Users need to understand and control how their data is used.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing privacy settings and successfully updating data control preferences.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to control privacy, **When** they access privacy settings, **Then** they can adjust their data sharing preferences
2. **Given** a user wants to export their data, **When** they request data export, **Then** they receive their complete viewing history and emotional data
3. **Given** a user wants to control notifications, **When** they adjust notification settings, **Then** their preferences are saved and applied
4. **Given** a user wants to understand data usage, **When** they view privacy information, **Then** they see clear explanations of how their data is used

### User Story 3 - Account Deletion (Priority: P3)

A user can delete their account and all associated data when they no longer want to use VibeVault.

**Why this priority**: While not commonly used, account deletion is important for user control and privacy compliance. Users should be able to completely remove their data.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by requesting account deletion and verifying that all user data is completely removed.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to delete their account, **When** they request account deletion, **Then** they receive clear confirmation of what will be deleted
2. **Given** a user confirms deletion, **When** they complete the process, **Then** their account and all data are permanently removed
3. **Given** a user deletes their account, **When** they try to log in later, **Then** they cannot access their old data
4. **Given** a user wants to delete their account, **When** they start the process, **Then** they can cancel before final confirmation
