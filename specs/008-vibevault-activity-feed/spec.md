# Feature Specification: VibeVault Activity Feed & Notifications

**Feature Branch**: `008-vibevault-activity-feed`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Real-time activity feed and notification system for social interactions and friend activity updates

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Activity Feed (Priority: P1)

A user views a real-time feed of their friends' viewing activities, emotional responses, and social interactions to stay connected with their community.

**Why this priority**: This creates the "social pulse" of VibeVault. Without an activity feed, the social features feel disconnected and users miss out on the community aspect.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having friends log content and verifying that their activities appear in the user's feed in real-time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has friends who are active, **When** they view their activity feed, **Then** they see recent viewing activities from their friends
2. **Given** a friend logs new content, **When** the user refreshes their feed, **Then** they see the friend's new viewing experience with emotional response
3. **Given** a user views the activity feed, **When** they see friend activities, **Then** they can click to view full details of the logged content
4. **Given** a user has many active friends, **When** they scroll through the feed, **Then** they can see a chronological timeline of all activities

### User Story 2 - Receive Real-time Notifications (Priority: P1)

A user receives notifications when friends log new content, send friend requests, or interact with their content to stay engaged with the community.

**Why this priority**: Notifications keep users engaged and create a sense of community. Users need to know when their friends are active to maintain social connections.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a friend perform actions and verifying that the user receives appropriate notifications.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a friend logs new content, **When** they complete their log entry, **Then** the user receives a notification about their friend's activity
2. **Given** a user receives a friend request, **When** someone sends them a request, **Then** they get an immediate notification
3. **Given** a friend reacts to the user's content, **When** they interact with a log entry, **Then** the user receives a notification about the interaction
4. **Given** a user has multiple notifications, **When** they view their notification center, **Then** they can see all pending notifications clearly

---

### User Story 3 - Interact with Feed Content (Priority: P2)

A user interacts with friends' activities in the feed by reacting, commenting, or sharing content to build community engagement.

**Why this priority**: Interactions create deeper social connections and make the feed more engaging. This transforms the feed from passive consumption to active community participation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reacting to friends' activities and verifying that the interactions are recorded and visible to the friend.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sees a friend's activity in their feed, **When** they want to react, **Then** they can like, comment, or share the content
2. **Given** a user reacts to a friend's log, **When** they submit their reaction, **Then** the friend receives a notification about the interaction
3. **Given** a user wants to discuss content, **When** they comment on a friend's activity, **Then** their comment appears and the friend is notified
4. **Given** a user wants to share interesting content, **When** they share from the feed, **Then** they can easily share with other friends or save for later

---

### User Story 4 - Manage Notification Preferences (Priority: P2)

A user controls their notification settings to customize what types of activities they want to be notified about and how they receive notifications.

**Why this priority**: Users need control over their notification experience. Too many notifications can be overwhelming, while too few can make users feel disconnected.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adjusting notification settings and verifying that the user receives only the types of notifications they've enabled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user wants to control notifications, **When** they access notification settings, **Then** they can customize what types of activities trigger notifications
2. **Given** a user changes notification preferences, **When** they save settings, **Then** their notification experience is updated accordingly
3. **Given** a user wants to reduce notifications, **When** they disable certain types, **Then** they stop receiving those specific notifications
4. **Given** a user wants to be notified immediately, **When** they enable push notifications, **Then** they receive real-time alerts for important activities

- How does the system handle users who want to see activity from friends who have changed their privacy settings?
- What happens when a user wants to hide certain types of activities from their feed?
- How does the system handle users who want to mute specific friends temporarily?
- What happens when a user receives notifications while offline?
- How does the system handle users who want to export their activity feed data?
