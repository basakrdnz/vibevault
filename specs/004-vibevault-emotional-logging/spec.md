## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Log Viewing Experience (Priority: P1)

A user logs a movie, series, or documentary they've watched, including their emotional response, rating, and personal notes about their experience.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of VibeVault - capturing not just what users watched, but how it made them feel. This is the primary differentiator from simple rating apps.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting a title and successfully logging a complete viewing experience with emotional notes and rating.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user finds content they want to log, **When** they click "Log This", **Then** they see a form to record their viewing experience
2. **Given** a user is logging content, **When** they select emotional responses and add notes, **Then** the system saves their complete experience
3. **Given** a user rates content, **When** they submit their log entry, **Then** it appears in their viewing history with all details preserved
4. **Given** a user wants to mark content as favorite, **When** they toggle the favorite option, **Then** it's added to their favorites list

### User Story 2 - Emotional Response Capture (Priority: P1)

A user captures how a movie, series, or documentary made them feel using predefined emotional categories and free-form notes.

**Why this priority**: The emotional aspect is what makes VibeVault unique. Users must be able to easily express and record their emotional responses to content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by logging content and successfully capturing emotional responses through both structured categories and personal notes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logging content, **When** they select emotional responses, **Then** they can choose from predefined emotional categories
2. **Given** a user wants to add personal context, **When** they write notes, **Then** they can add free-form text about their experience
3. **Given** a user logs their experience, **When** they submit the form, **Then** both emotional categories and personal notes are saved together
4. **Given** a user wants to express complex emotions, **When** they use the system, **Then** they can select multiple emotional responses

---

### User Story 3 - Rating and Favorites (Priority: P2)

A user rates content on a standard scale and marks content as favorites for quick access and personal curation.

**Why this priority**: While emotional responses are the core differentiator, ratings provide a standard way to evaluate content, and favorites help users curate their preferred content.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rating content and marking items as favorites, then verifying these actions are saved and accessible.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is logging content, **When** they rate it, **Then** they can use a standard rating scale (e.g., 1-10 or 1-5 stars)
2. **Given** a user wants to mark favorites, **When** they toggle the favorite option, **Then** the content is added to their favorites list
3. **Given** a user has rated content, **When** they view their history, **Then** they can see their ratings alongside their emotional notes
4. **Given** a user wants to change their rating, **When** they edit their log entry, **Then** they can update their rating and notes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when users try to log the same content multiple times?
- How does the system handle very long emotional notes or special characters?
- What happens when users want to log content that's not available in the system?
- How does the system handle users who want to log partial viewing (e.g., only watched first episode of series)?
- What happens when users want to edit or delete their logged experiences?
- How does the system handle users who want to log content they watched years ago?
